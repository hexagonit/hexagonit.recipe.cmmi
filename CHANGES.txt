Change History
**************

1.3.0 (xxxx-xx-xx)
==================

  - Added new options ``environment-section`` and ``environment`` to control
    environment variables before executing the recipe.

  - Added new option ``prefix`` to override the installation prefix. Defaults
    to the previously hardcoded value of the part location.

1.2.0
=====

  - Added new ``configure-command`` option to control the command used to
    generate the ``Makefile``. This makes it possible to build slightly
    different packages, e.g. Perl projects where Makefile.PL replaces the
    configure script.

1.1.1
=====

  - Don't try to execute hooks if the option is an empty string. This
    will make it possible to disable hooks when extending existing
    parts.

1.1.0
=====

 - Added new option ``path`` to allow building and installing local
   source trees. The ``path`` option is mutually exclusive with
   ``url``.

1.0.1
=====

 - Fixed a bug with 'keep-compile-dir' option. The location of the
   compilation directory was not available through the
   ``options['compile-directory']`` option as documented.

1.0.0
=====

 - Initial public release.
